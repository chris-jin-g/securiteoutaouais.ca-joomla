Two Columns will set all positions in that row to 50% and two positions per row. Three Columns will set all positions in that row to 33.33% and three positions per row. Redis. 33/50 will set positions 1 through 3 to 33.33% and positions 4 through 6 to 50%, this setting is meant to be used when positions 1 through 5 are in use.

Disabling the show frontpage article/component area in General Options will also disable the mobile version's frontpage area."

TPL_FIELD_RESPON_DESC="The options listed below direclty relate to the responsive layout features. A responsive layout will adapt to any screen size, whether it be an extra wide monitor or smart phone, this layout can handle it all. Keep in mind that when using responsive layouts that not all content or third party extensions have been built for responsive layouts. If you are unsure of how responsive layouts work, or if your required extensions do not meet responsive layout design specifications, then we do not recommend you enable these features. If you are comfortable developing a site with a responsive layout then proceed. Your first step in enabling the responsive layout is to set your page and column widths above. The responsive layout will work with fixed or fluid. Then proceed to the settings below. Be sure to visit <a href='http://www.shape5.com/documentation/General/Miscellaneous/Responsive-Best-Practices' target='_blank'>http://www.shape5.com/documentation/General/Miscellaneous/Responsive-Best-Practices</a> and download and review Responsive Best Practices."

TPL_FIELD_RESPONSIVEBARTRIGGER_LABEL="Trigger Width"
TPL_FIELD_RESPONSIVEBARTRIGGER_DESC="This is the width where the mobile layout takes effect. We recommend using 750 for this setting, but it can be more or less.

TPL_FIELD_RESPONSIVELARGEWIDTH_DESC="If your trigger width is set high to allow the menu to show on larger screens you can use this setting to force the off canvas area to a set px width. Once the screen size reaches 650px this settings will be overridden and 80% will be used instead."
TPL_FIELD_RESPONLOGREG_DESC="In order to enable login and register for mobile simply publish any extension to the login or register positions and that is all. If you are using the S5 Box then the extensions will already be published to these positions, and there are no extra steps needed. You may also enter your own custom urls under the General tab. Register will automatically disappear when a user is logged in. If you are enabling the registration links be sure you have enabled registration in the global configuration area as well. Alternatively you can also enter your own login and register urls under the General tab. Below you can also brute force disable the login and register links for mobile and leave enabled for desktop users."

These settings essentially limit the result to all tablets in landscape mode where the flex menu is still visiible. The browser width check also keeps desktops and laptops that have touch screen monitors with the standard onmouseover functionality. Please note this function will only work if responsive is enabled on the Layout tab."

TPL_FIELD_RESIZE_COLUMNS_ROW_DIST_LABEL="Equalize Heights On Row Re-Distribution?"
TPL_FIELD_RESIZE_COLUMNS_ROW_DIST_DESC="This setting is directly related to the row re-distribution fields for narrow screens found under the Layout tab. The row re-distribution feature splits a single row into multiple rows at specified screen widths, however the heights will still be calculated based on the tallest position in a particular section. In other words all positions in a split row will remain all the same heights. In some cases this may give an undesirable effect and you may wish to disable the equal heights feature once the row re-distribution is triggered. This will only effect positions once the row re-distribution is triggered and it will not effect other positions on the page."

Parallax causes the background image of an element to scroll at a different speed than your browser. Be sure to read the tooltips if a question mark icon is available for further instructions.
